# The DCA_SVM_RkSOP approach
Sparse optimization for SVM-based feature-selection via vector-k-norm regularization and DC programming.

An approach presented in:

Gaudioso M, Giallombardo G, Miglionico G (2023) "Sparse optimization via vector k-norm and DC programming with an application to feature selection for Support Vector Machines", submitted for publication.

See the folder "DCA_SVM_kNorm" for the Python implementation of DCA-SVM-RkSOP.

See the folder "DataSets" for some well known test-instances in binary classification.
