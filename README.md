# Feature_Selection_SVM
SVM-based feature selection via k-norm reformulation of sparse optimization and DC programming.

See the folder "Source Code" for the Python implementation of DCA-SVM-RkSOP, a feature selection SVM based on vector-k-norms and DC programming.

See the folder "DataSets" for some well known test-instances in binary classification.
