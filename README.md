# Feature_Selection_SVM
Sparse optimization for SVM feature selection via vector-k-norm regularization and DC programming.

See the folder "DCA_SVM_kNorm" for the Python implementation of DCA-SVM-RkSOP, a feature selection SVM based on vector-k-norms and DC programming.

See the folder "DataSets" for some well known test-instances in binary classification.
